Hi! I am a final-year (senior) undergrad majoring in Software Engineering at Qingdao University of Technology. I plan to pursue a master's degree at UNIST in the fall of 2024.

My current research interests are combining **Graph Machine Learning** theory and **Large Language Model** techniques to create applications. (In the past three months, I have taken the course "Stanford CS224W" via YouTube, which has fascinated me.)

What I’m obsessed with learning:

- in 2023: NLP(CS224N), Trustworthy LLMs, Recommender Systems. 

- in 2022: Hadoop, Spark, Flink, Data Mining, Visualization Education. 

- in 2021: Python, Machine Learning Models, Mobile App Development.

- in 2020: C/C++, Java, Web Development wtih Springboot and Vue.js.
